# skill-backtest

## Executable DAG interface

`scripts/backtest_dag.py` accepts `factor-panel@1.0.0` and `market-bar@1.0.0` JSON envelopes and requires explicit strategy, horizon, top percentile, fee, and output arguments. It rejects multiple factors, neutral direction, missing tradability or limit evidence, and non-bijective native/canonical records; it emits `backtest-result@1.0.0`, `evaluation-result@1.0.0`, and a hashed internal return-series artifact. Research and education only; not investment advice.

Not a backtest framework, but a **standard protocol for cross-section long-only backtesting**: T+1 open execution, Top equal weight, 15bp two-way fee, limit-up/down exclusion, 4-panel diagnostic chart, 5-item health check.

`skill-backtest` is the **cross-section long-only backtest Skill** provided by PandaAI Quant Skills. It standardizes the chain "signal → real-money NAV curve": unified execution assumptions, unified fees, unified diagnostics — so backtests of different factors are comparable.

## 🎯 What This Skill Solves

Backtests are bug-prone, and bugs always make backtests look better:

- Using `close[T]` as T-day execution price → Sharpe goes to the moon
- Not excluding limit-up/down → returns from un-buyable trades
- No fees → high-turnover strategies pretend to make money
- Backtesting 2018 with currently-alive stocks → survivorship bias
- T+0 assumption on A-shares → not achievable in live

This Skill **locks all these assumptions**, plus a **5-item health check**:

- Holding count stable near Top X%
- Daily turnover ≈ 2/H
- Sharpe ≈ IC_IR × 0.3 ~ 0.5
- MDD between -20% and -40%
- Full-position time > 80%

Any item failing → suspect a bug, don't trust the result.

## ⚡ Backtest Protocol

| Item | Standard |
|---|---|
| Selection | Daily Top 10% by signal cross-section rank |
| Entry | T+1 open |
| Exit | T+1+H open |
| Sizing | Equal weight (Top N split equally) |
| Overlap | 1/H capital rebalanced daily (rolling sleeves) |
| Cannot buy | `trade_status==1` or `close >= limit_up*0.99` |
| Cannot sell | `trade_status==1` or `close <= limit_down*1.01` |
| Fee | 15 bp two-way |
| Capital | Infinite, no market impact |

## 🗃️ Input Requirements

Market panel must contain:

```
date, symbol, open, close, high, low, volume,
trade_status, limit_up, limit_down
```

Cross-market adjustments: US stocks have no limit-up/down — use proxies like `gap_open > 5%`; futures by product. See `references/assumptions.md`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Drop `skill-backtest/` into your Agent's skills directory. Auto-loaded on triggers ("backtest / NAV plot / benchmark comparison").

## 📊 Standard Diagnostic Chart (4-panel baseline)

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ ① NAV curve         │ ② Cumulative IC     │
│   strategy vs bench │   cum daily rank IC │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ ③ Quantile returns  │ ④ Drawdown          │
│   Q1 ~ Q5 bars      │   underwater curve  │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

Advanced 6-panel: add monthly heatmap + turnover timeline. See `references/diagnostic-charts.md`.

## 🧪 5-Item Health Check (mandatory after backtest)

| Check | Expected | If failed |
|---|---|---|
| Holding count | ≈ Top X% | universe wrong / limit-up filter too strict |
| Turnover | ≈ 2/H | signal noise-dominated |
| Sharpe vs IC_IR | Sharpe ≈ IC_IR × 0.3 ~ 0.5 | close-as-price / no fees / T+0 |
| MDD | -20% ~ -40% | < 5% almost certainly look-ahead |
| Full position time | > 80% | too many NaN in signal |

## 📜 Project Status & Boundaries

- **Status**: Community Project, not officially reviewed / certified / endorsed
- **Data Source**: This repository ships no market data. Users must supply their own market panel; data legality and licensing are the user's responsibility
- **Core Assumptions**: T+1 open execution, Top 10% equal weight, 15bp two-way fee; infinite capital, no market impact
- **Known Limitations**: No call auction slippage / shorting constraints / large-order impact simulated; no dividend / split / corporate action handling
- **Risk Boundary**: Backtest NAV reflects simulated returns under historical data + assumptions only, not future performance, **not equivalent to live-attainable returns**
- **Usage**: For quantitative research, education, and methodology reference only. **Does not constitute investment advice, trading signals, or profit guarantees of any form**
